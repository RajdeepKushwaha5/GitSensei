ðŸš€ Day 4 of AI Agent course COMPLETE! Built a conversational agent with Gemini API that uses hybrid search to answer course questions.

Key wins:
âœ… Manual function calling (built-in tools had issues)
âœ… Gemini 2.0 Flash integration
âœ… Secure API management
âœ… Hit rate limits testing (200 req/day free tier!)

The agent actually works - searches FAQ database and provides accurate answers! ðŸ¤–
